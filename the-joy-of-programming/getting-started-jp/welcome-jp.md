# Welcome

Welcome to the Joy of Programming!

The Joy of Programming is a novel course to explore the magical world of
computer programming.

This course uses creative coding as a medium, as in you'll write programs
to draw various patterns on the screen. It is a lot fun to learn programming
this way than just printing some numbers on the screen. It is
really amazing to see your ideas come to life in front of your eyes.

This course uses Python programming language, but only a small subset of
the language features. The goal of this course is not to make the
students great at Python, but to provide them with tools of thinking
that can be applied to programming, irrespective of the programming language.

This is not a trivial course by any means. There is enough in this course
to challenge you, amuse you and surprise you.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes no prior programming experience.

However, it is assumed that you are reasonably good at doing simple math.

To tell the computer where to draw a shape and how big, you also need
to know a bit of coordinate geometry. Don't worry if you don't know much,
it will be explained in detail in one of the upcoming lessons.

## Approach

The focus of the course is on programming, not on a programming language.
You'll learn, practice and internalize the fundamental ideas, techniques
of programming.

This is an interactive course with a lot of examples and exercises
baked into the lessons. The exercises are carefully designed to make you
practice the important concepts explained in the lessons.
